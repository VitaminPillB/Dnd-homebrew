She strides through the fire, a redish, magical barrier protecting her from the worst of the flames. The shocked dragon has little time to react to the impossibly alive elf before her twin blades start cutting through its scales.",

Perhaps you were a trained soldier chosen for your intelligence to learn magic to help your cause win a war. Maybe you apprenticed with a swordmage mentor who taught you all they knew and now you are striking out on your own.",
